# PIN Generator - James Ibberson

## Tools 
- Laravel 7 
- Vue 2 
- Docker / Docker Compose 

## The Application 
The application is a PIN (personal identification number) generator. It can output between 1 and 10 PINs at a time. 

### Requirements 
- Each PIN comprises four numeric digits (e.g. “2845”),
- No “obvious” numbers (such as “1111”),
- PINs should appear in apparently random order,
- Not repeat PINs until all the preceding valid PINs have been emitted - even if the program is stopped and started between PINs.

### Approach
In order to meet the requirements, PINs generated by this program will:
- consist of all unique digits 
- contain sequences of consecutive numbers no longer than 2

All the possible PINs are pre-generated, and then returned to user in a random order.  
Each PIN that is returned is marked as used, until all PINs have been used. Then, used markers are reset and so on.
